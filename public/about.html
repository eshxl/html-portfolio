<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Eshal, a 3rd-year Software Engineering student at VIT University with a passion for coding,
   web development, AI, and all things tech. I’m constantly learning and improving my skills, 
   focusing on one area at a time to deepen my knowledge and expertise in software engineering.</p>

<p>When I’m not diving into code or exploring the latest in technology, you’ll find me relaxing with 
  music, binge-watching series, or spending quality time offline with friends and family. I also love
   making videos, capturing moments, and taking photos that tell a story.</p>

<p>Feel free to connect with me if you want to chat about tech, collaborate on projects, or share 
  some cool recommendations!</p>
